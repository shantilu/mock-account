This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Front end UI is based on And Design, together with a simulator REST API backend with json-server.

Redux or other state management framework is not used as local state managment works fine for current scope.

Run `npm install` in the repository
Run `npm run start_server` in one terminal
Then `npm run start_cypress_tests` in another terminal

Control-c once finished.
